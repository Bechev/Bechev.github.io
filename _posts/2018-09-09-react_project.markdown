That's it, the last project.
What I appreciated the most on this project is that what frustrated me the most became the most enjoyable of it. The curriculum of the scholl does not cover 100% of what we need to do.
I felt that was good as it taught us something at the heart of the software engineering job: problem solving.
Most of the job is to figure out stuff. That has or has not already been solved by others (mostly has been though).
In this cas, figuring out how to tie a back end to our front end including presisting new objects created on the front end ended up being extremly rewarding. 
Loved it.

Besides that. the project was longer and not all the functionnalities I was envisionning are implemented. But this time, I feel this is a product I will keep working on.
I started with an idea of someone who needed such a website. It obviously need some more work but it's a decent start.
