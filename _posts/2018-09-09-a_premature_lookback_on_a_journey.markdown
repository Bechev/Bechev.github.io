While my journey comes to an end, it feels like a good time to have a first look back on it
l got in the Flatiron program to take a hobby to the next level. I always liked programming and decided
to learn once and for all. What I learnt is however more than what I was expecting.
I did learn how to program. What I mostly understood throughout the course of the curriculum is that
programing is not the skill of being able to write a computer program. Given the multiplicity of
programming languages, libraries for each of them and also the purposes of programming (developing a
website, a video game or an Al are things as different as writing a user's manual, a poem or a book) one
cannot just "know how to program". One can learn how to structure its mind a thoughts to be able to
put together a computer program. And that will be true whatever language you use and whatever you
are programing for.
This is what I learnt at the Flatiron. The concept of the Flatiron is, for each of the topics covered, to
break them down up to the lower level possible and to then understand why conventions are this and
that. This allowed me to understand the concepts and apply them.
Overall, I believe the Flatiron school taught me a lot. Whether I will switch career to become a software
engineer or not following this is another story.
What I however know is that I will definitely take my hobby to another level and try to make some
money out of it!# A premature lookback on a journey
