The thrid project is a full rails web app - I feel this one can be the start of something I could expand going forward. I am going to start the logic of an online shop (defining categories, and looking for items by brand - the cart etc will come later).

I will have 3 models allowing to use the has_many :through concept. This should be interesting. In addition to those, I will have a static controller and some users. 
I will first struggle to be clear on the logic of my app. I am not clear on how I want it to work and I will have to change the logic a few times. Still now I am not sure it is best practice, but I am happy with the functionnalities that I got.

Once I'm started everything is fine. The big roadblock will be to figure out how the paths work. With rails comes a lot of abstraction. It's hard to keep everything in mind.

The last big piece that I hav eis the authentification through facebook. This is a bit confusing at first. I had to redo the setup a couple of times. But it's now working.
Onto JS!
