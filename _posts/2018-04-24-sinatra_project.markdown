Time for the second project. Sinatra. It has been a tough journey to get over this part of the curriculum. Lots of frustration. A lot of personnal work on the side. Finally over - I'm glad. 
The great thing it's that this is really tangible and I feel I can now build real stuff, that can be useful to a non programmer. 
That feels good.

The project is simple - as part of a side project, I wanted to build a tracker of crypto investments. This is the first step to that - recording transactions.

First thing I did is: use what I learnt from Flatiron. I asked advices. I was shared a gem to setup my folder structure for the project. A former flatiron student ! Thanks thebrianemory for corneal. That was really useful !
Once that's setup. it's easy. Creating the migration, then the db. Awesome, it's working. Let's try it a bit in tux and see that everything is fine. Done.

Next let's build some beautiful RESTful routes. Everything start with the user controller to manage login and singnup. Then the transactions.

Everything works fairly easily, my main roadblock will have been the Rack::MethodOverride.
Once I got that, wrapping up is not too long. The project is done. After buidling Fwitter, it's very close and I did get the concepts. 
Hopefully I'll be able to clearly share what I learned during the project.

Can't wait for the next one.
