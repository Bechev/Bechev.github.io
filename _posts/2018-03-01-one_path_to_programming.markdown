 I discovered coding pretty late in my life. With a major in Finance, I was taught to build excel macros.
 As soon as I tried I loved it. I quickly stoped building financial models during my classes to focus on coloring some excel cells following promatically defined patterns. I LOVED it. My  master piece was this VBA christmas tree I build while working in a trading room in Paris.  The lights changed and all - my boss liked less than me strangely...
 
 Long story short, I always kept programming as a hobby on the side. I learned some C++ or Java, I tried developing some games through the unity engine etc. But never took my skills to the next level...
 A few years ago, I moved in the US for work (Hey ! I'm French !) and felt the vibe around programming and the possibility of doing a bootcamp to switch career.
 
 I didn't need more. I want to get paid for programming instead of it being just a hobby.
